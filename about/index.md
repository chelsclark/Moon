Hi! My name is Chelsea Clark (some people call me Chels) and I am a writer, designer, and marketer. I currently attend Cedarville University where I am studying Professional Writing and Information Design. I also plan to graduate with three business minors: Marketing (of course), Business Administration, and International Business. 

I really enjoy writing, but I think I enjoy designing more. I have written, edited, and designed documents for [Maple Tree Cancer Alliance](https://www.mapletreecanceralliance.org/). Check out some of the work I've done for Maple Tree under Projects or check out my [Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1naH1AVDMFpxoKecYlxkZn-jVCVocjvuLMH33TDbL4CI/edit?usp=sharing) to see all of my experience!
